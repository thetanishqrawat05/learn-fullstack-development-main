Challenge
=========

1. Create a new directory as a child of the app directory. Call it "about"
2. Inside that new "about" directory, create a new file called "page.jsx"
   (It's important the file name be exactly "page.jsx", all lowercase.)
   (Currently in Scrimba, to create a file inside a folder, you need to expand
   that folder first, then right-click on the folder and choose "New File")
3. Export a React component that renders any kind of element. An `h1` for example.
4. In the mini browser, type `/about` in the URL bar and hit enter. See what happens!
