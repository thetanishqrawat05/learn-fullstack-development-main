Challenge:
==========
Your turn to create a new Next.js app from scratch! Don't hesitate to refer to the
documentation linked in the slides for reference. Do type things out from scratch
instead of copy/pasting though!

1. Install the latest versions of `next`, `react`, and `react-dom`
2. Create an app folder
3. Inside the app folder, create a `layout.jsx` file and add 
   a React component similar to the one shown in the docs.
   (It should include `html` and `body` elements, receive
   a `children` prop, and render the `children` in the `body
   element.)
4. Inside the app folder, create a `page.jsx` file and add
   a React component that returns some simple HTML. Again, you
   can refer to the docs, but don't copy/paste the example component
   there!
