At Mike's Bikes, they also sell bike racks (endpoint is /bikeracks).

What would you expect the endpoints to be for the following tasks:

1. Get a list of all bike racks sold on the site?


2. Get a list of all bike racks available in the physical store right now?
   (Assume a query called "available" that is a boolean true/false)


3. Get a list of all "Thule"-brand bike racks that can hold 4 bikes?
   (Assume there are "brand" and "numBikes" queries)
